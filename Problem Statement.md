# Grid 4.0 SDE Problem Statements
## Problem Statement 1: MetaCommerce - The Future of Shopping with Metaverse

*How about building the future of immersive shopping with possibilities of VR, AR, and immersive 3D worlds/Metaverses
for e-Commerce? This hack expects you to Create a connected Metaverse experience on the web, in which anyone
with a web browser can join and experience a 3D world along with their friends to browse & shop. Create a connected
experience by interacting with your friends or fellow shoppers in the metaverse, enabling try-on experiences on your
avatar. You can have fun by having voice-enabled conversations and camera enablements. There’s no limit to bringing
in your creativity - Feel free to add features like - Creating an avatar of yourself and shopping around in the metaverse,
Access Digital assets - View the item in a 3D format in the virtual space, Virtual Try Ons*
<br>
<br>
<br>
`Example & References :`
- An example would be a miniature version of https://decentraland.org/ or https://spatial.io/ on the
web.
- For Connected experience, you can check APIs provided on https://hubs.mozilla.com/ and also
refer to A-Frame
- For 3D digital asset, use https://sketchfab.com/features/free-3d-models as a reference.
- For 3D Viewer, you can refer (https://doc.babylonjs.com/divingDeeper/webXR/introToWebXR) or
Scene Viewer from Google or WebXR
- For Virtual world ( Ref: ) Xiaomi Microverse, Forever 21 Store in Decentraland (walk around for
other shops)
### The solution should focus on:
● Building a web-based metaverse using out-of-the-box Avatar generation tools for users to enter and
experience. HInt - Existing open source solutions can be used. <br>
● Building a shared 3D space on the web that is shared concurrently by many users. Hint- Any existing
3D spaces can be used.<br>
● We are listing a few feature suggestions below - Feel free to use a part or all of them in your
experience Or additional features can be added too. The idea is to build a next-gen futuristic
Metaverse Shopping experience.<br>
● Ability to view products in 3D in the shared spaces and AR as well (You may allow users to scan a QR
code to view products in AR on their phone)
<br>
● Ability to try-on apparels etc on the Avataar.
<br>
● Bonus- Add-to-cart/checkout of the product
<br>
● Bonus- Voice chat with fellow shoppers, enablement of camera
<br>
● Bonus- Use your imagination and create innovative experiences.
<br>
## Judging Criteria:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● The solution should be easy to use and should have an immersive experience. A nice clean working
demo is mandatory,<br>
● It should be a connected experience, with as many feature sets using - 3D viewer, AR, VTO, Avatars,
etc.<br>
● Well-defined APIs and SDKs architecture documentation for integration by Partners.<br>
● Code quality, extensibility<br>

## Problem Statement 2: Blockchain-based eCommerce warranty system using NFTs

**The objective is to replace the physical warranty and have block chain based warranty using NFT which will ensure
authenticity and security.**
<br>
- Converting ownership authenticity and product warranty cards into decaying NFTs.
- For instance, allow brands and retailers to introduce an NFT for each of their products, which allows
customers to receive the physical product along with a digital version of it.
-  Customers can then use the digital NFT to verify the authenticity of their product, prove their ownership of
their product, and transfer ownership of them upon resale.
-  The brand/retailer should also be able to tie the digital NFT to its warranty program, allowing owners to track
repairs and replacements to the original item.
-  Decay the NFT once the warranty is over.
-  You can use the Polygon blockchain to deploy your solution and demo the final product as a web prototype
### Example on the Klatyn Chain - Korean retailer issues blockchain warranties as NFTs for luxury items - Ledger Insights
## What are we expecting:
-  The blockchain smart contract should allow users to prove ownership
-  Provide the purchasing history, warranty period, and other item information
-  The warranty card should include the item’s serial number and upon purchase be sent to the customer’s
smartphone.
-  The NFTs should be decaying in nature, in that, after a certain period their use for the redemption of warranty
benefits offered by the brand/retailer will expire
-  Bonus - GUI-based tool that doesn’t require knowledge of any Blockchain programming to use by Brands and
Retailers.
- Bonus - Usage of Soulbound NFTs
-  Bonus - Add any engagement/gamification construct to the loyalty program
## Judging Criteria :
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The demo of the key feature/functions you were able to implement should be simple (No
code to be used in the demo)
- Clean and well-structured Solidity code/templates
- Feature sets
## Problem Statement 3: Extract Trends from social media data
<br>
As part of this challenge, teams are expected to identify trends from social media data; From all the
products available on Flipkart identify trending products, utilize all signals available (ex. posts, sessions,
check-ins, social graphs, media content, etc.).
<br>
- Output should also have photos, videos, gifs which can be used on Flipkart app.
 <br>
- Preferred tech: Open source
<br>
- Bonus: Signal extraction from multiple social media channels (ex. FB, Instagram, Twitter, etc.)
<br>
